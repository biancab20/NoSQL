# NoSQL

Inholland University of Applied Sciences - Year 2

.NET group project application using NoSQL MongoDB for incident management. We design both the database and application for managing employees and tickets for service desk administrators. I learned how to use pipelines and how to securely implement "forgot password" functionality, sending a unique key at the specified email address.
